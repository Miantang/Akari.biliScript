/* Sample: HelloWorld
 * A minimalist sample that displays a single line of that famous quote on the screen for a minute.
 *
 * The sample can serve as a introduction but is by no means good practice. Note that Akari.biliScript is more for big stuff,
 * and less for code shorter than the library itself. A simple $.createComment( "Hello World!", { lifeTime : 60 } ); would be much more fit for this job.
